## Architecture

I have used a simple attempt at Clean Architecture.

## Version control

Ihave used git to version files in this project. Normally I use gitflow to create features, releases and hotfixes.

I am not designer although I try to make a android design with CollapsingToolbarLayout in image detail and circle image crop in list item.

## Tests

I've added some tests (using Mockito and JUnit).
